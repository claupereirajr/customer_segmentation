    "## Roadmap of project\n",
    "1. Data Collection: Start by collecting customer data from a retail business, such as purchase history, demographic information, and customer feedback. This data can be stored in a database, such as MySQL, or in a flat file, such as a CSV.\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing: Next, you'll need to preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and any other issues that might affect the results of the segmentation analysis. This could involve imputing missing values, normalizing continuous variables, and encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering: Once the data is preprocessed, you'll need to extract meaningful features from it. This could involve calculating customer-level aggregate statistics, such as total spend and average transaction size, or using natural language processing to analyze customer feedback.\n",
    "4. Clustering: To identify customer segments, you'll need to use a clustering algorithm, such as K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering. You'll want to experiment with different numbers of clusters, and use techniques such as elbow plots and silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters.\n",
    "5. Visualization and Analysis: Once you have identified the customer segments, you can use data visualization tools, such as matplotlib or seaborn, to explore the characteristics of each segment. You can then use this information to inform targeted marketing campaigns for each segment.\n",
    "6. Model Deployment: To make the results of the customer segmentation analysis available to the retail business, you can use a dashboard tool, such as Tableau or PowerBI, to create a visual representation of the segments and their characteristics. You can also use the results to inform product recommendations, email marketing campaigns, and other customer-facing initiatives."
